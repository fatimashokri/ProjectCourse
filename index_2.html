<p>Our environment can play a very important role when it comes to our mood.
 Sometimes life gets hard and it becomes difficult to see the light in the darkness around us. To feel better,
 having a positive mindset is very necessary, but also the objects and beings that surround us are critical too.</p>

and also they seem to have an increased life satisfaction overall.</p>

The ancient Greeks and Romans identified the rose with the goddesses of love, Aphrodite and Venus respectively.

so attractive that roses are considered a favourite flower for weddings, as a gift for a special someone, and as a 
symbol of true love and friendship.They can also help us eliminate stress. As a study in the Journal 
of Physiological Anthropology found, office workers who looked at roses felt more 
relaxed and comfortable in their work environment.</p>
